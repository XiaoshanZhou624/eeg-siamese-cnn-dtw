This is the code for:

Zhou et al., "Siamese Network with Dual Attention for EEG-Driven Social Learning: Bridging the Human-Robot Gap in Long-Tail Autonomous Driving."

This project is a collaboration between Prof. Carol Menassa’s lab and Prof. Vineet Kamat’s lab at the University of Michigan. The model is designed for analyzing and classifying EEG signals in complex human perception-cognition-action coupling.

We welcome interest from others—please feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss using or building upon this model!
